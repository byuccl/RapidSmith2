This file summarizes the architecture of the placer.


PlacementGroup (abstract class)
 The atomic unit of placement. It is composed of one or more Instance objects. If
 it has more than one Instance, the placement arrangement between the instances is fixed.
 Each placement group has an anchor that must be placed. When the anchor is placed, all
 instances in the group are placed. 
 Related classes:
  - SingleInstancePlacementGroup (a placement group with one instance - 99% of the groups)
  - MultipleInstancePlacementGroup (allows multiple instances in a group)
 
DesignPlacementGroups
 Represents all of the placement groups of a design. It is responsible for identifying all
 of the placement groups that can be placed. This is created from a Design. It does not
 contain any Placement state.
 TODO: this class name is not ideal. Potential names: PlaceableDesign
 
TypeSiteCoordinates
 Represents the coordinate system for a specific type. It provides a convenient way
 to access the x,y PrimitiveSite for a specific type. This coordinate system is unconstrained
 meaning it represents all valid sites in the device for the particular primitive type.

AreaPlacementConstraint
 Represents a constraint for a specific TypeSiteCoordinates object. This object constrains
 the locations where PlacementGroups can be placed.

  - SquareAreaConstraint

PlacerState
 Contains the actual state of the placement (i.e., where the PlacementGroup objects are
 currently placed). This is a dynamic structure that changes during placement. It also
 contains the current constraints used for a device.

DefaultFinalGroupPlacement
 This class stores the placement of a design as a single object. After placement, this
 object can be created. This object is immutable meaning that the placement does not
 change. It is also easy to serialize. The PlacerState object contains the placement but
 the PlacerState class manages the dynamic placement of the design. The DefaultFinalGroupPlacement 
 class is used to store the placement state in much less memory and without the ability to change it.
