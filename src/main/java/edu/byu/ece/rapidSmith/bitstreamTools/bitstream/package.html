This package is used to represent a Xilinx FPGA bitstream file. The 
details on how a bitstream is organized can be found in the following
Xilinx documents:
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/user_guides/ug071.pdf">Xilinx V4 COnfiguration Guide</a>
 
</ul>


This package
does NOT represent the bitstream as it exists on the FPGA but rather how the
bitstream is represented in a file and as it would be loaded into the FPGA.
The purpose of this package is as follows:
<ul>
<li> Represent bitstream files in a data structure that has already
     parsed the bitstream in a useable manner
<li> Provide support for creating new bitstreams by simplifying the
     process of creating bitstream packets.
<li> Provide support for parsing the bitstream from a file (a variety of formats)
<li> Provide support for writing out the bitstream in a variety of formats
</ul>
