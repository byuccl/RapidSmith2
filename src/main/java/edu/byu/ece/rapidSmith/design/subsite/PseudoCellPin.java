/**
 * This class represents a PseudoCellPin: a pin that can be created dynamically
 * and attached to a cell in the design. It is used to represent a CellPin that is
 * not logically represented, but is physically present. For example, when a SRL16E
 * cell is placed onto a LUT6 of a SLICEM, the A1 pin of the LUT6 needs to be routed
 * to VCC. However, this is not represented in the logical netlist. In this case, 
 * a PseudoCellPin can be created and attached to the SRL16E cell, and mapped onto the
 * A1 pin get a more accurate design representation. These CellPins behave exactly
 * the same way as other pins as in they can attach to nets and map to BelPins.
