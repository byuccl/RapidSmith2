=== Version 0.4.0 (26 FEB 2011) ===
This release of RapidSmith contains a major update in that it supports 
parsing bitstream packets and frames for Virtex 4, Virtex 5 and Virtex 6 
architectures. It removed the old Virtex 5 patch for BRAMs and has a complete
integrated solution for primitive site pin mappings for all devices supported.
It includes several bug fixes and new methods for PartNameTools.  
ModuleInstance contains several placement bug fixes.

=== Version 0.3.0 (29 JAN 2011) ===
This is a major update for RapidSmith.  The device files need to be rebuilt
in this version, this is due to adding support for several Xilinx legacy
devices (spartan2, spartan2e, spartan3, spartan3a, spartan 3adsp, spartan3e,
virtex, virtexe, virtex2, and virtex2p).  It also includes a new enum type
called FamilyType with a helper class called PartNameTools to help convert
Xilinx partnames to and from the FamilyType. An experimental timing report
(TWR) parser has been added.  The Design Explorer can load timing reports
using the new TWR parser and has been updated to show more information
about Nets.  Several bug fixes in the StaticSourceHandler when routing
Virtex 5 devices are included.  New packages: gui, tests and timing.
 
=== Version 0.2.2 (29 NOV 2010) ===
Added several features including a hard macro generator, a design explorer,
a device browser, and basic support for Spartan 6 devices.  Fixed a few bugs
in the basic router.  Added a class to merge static nets.  Added better 
support/documentation for Mac OS X users.

=== Version 0.2.1 (21 OCT 2010) ===
This version has a few big bug fixes to it.  First, the XDL design parser
has been completely rewritten and no longer uses JavaCC.  It is a custom
parser and loads designs 20-30% faster than the previous parser.  This
revision also contains a fix in the StaticSourceHandler which affects
the routers.  It was erroneously putting GND pins on VCC nets.  This 
version also adds a new deterministic XDL export method to compare XDL
files sanely.

=== Version 0.2.0 (8 OCT 2010) ===
This is a major revision upgrade as preliminary support for Virtex 6 parts
has been added.  An abstract router class as well as an example basic 
router has been added to the router package.  Although it is a full design
router, it still is quite basic and unoptimized.  A few fixes have been
made to the PartTileBrowser to work with Virtex 6 parts and how the scene
is rendered.  Fixed a bug with used primitive sites in the Design class.

=== Version 0.1.6 (30 SEP 2010) ===
Fixed a few more bugs. Upgraded to a newer version of Qt Jambi (4.6.3).
Fixed an XDL parser bug that would not parse XDL files without a 'cfg ""' 
entry in the design. Added a few more diagrams to the documentation.
Moved all license files to /doc/ folder and includes the NSF disclaimer
in the installer with a prompt for the user to agree to the license with
RapidSmith.

=== Version 0.1.5 (25 AUG 2010) ===
A few minor bug fixes such as device files now no longer are loaded
repetitively for the same device (this saves a significant amount of
time when loading several designs).  Device files no longer include
speed grade.  Added a recursive delete folder function in the
FileTools class.  The documentation format is better in this release.

=== Version 0.1.4 (19 AUG 2010) ===
The initial public release.
