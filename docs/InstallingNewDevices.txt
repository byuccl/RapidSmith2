OVERVIEW
--------

RapidSmith and RapidSmith2 both derive their device information from
XDLRC files.  However, these huge files must be processed and
compressed to be usable by either system.  In the process, these
programs correct problems with the XDLRC information and also create a
collection of important additional information they require.

This document will describe the process using RapidSmith2.  Note that
a single Artix7 device file and supporting metadata files have been
included in the RapidSmith2 distribution in the devices/artix7
directory.  As a result, you can learn and experiment with RapidSmith2
using that provided device file and need only be concerned with
generating new device files when you require a different device.

The big-picture steps to installing a new device or device family into
RapidSmith2 is as follows (note that as a user you do not have to do
a number of the steps):

1. Create a familyInfo.xml file.  This is an XML file that contains a
listing of the various primitive site types within the FPGA device.
Tincr and Tcl scripts can be used to obtain much of the information
needed for this file automatically.  <<This is only done once for a
given family and already exists in the distribution for the Artix 7
family in the devices/artix7 directory.>>

2. Create a cellLibrary.xml file.  This is an XML file that describes
the various cells which are found in the netlists for a given device
family.  This can be automatically created using TCL scripts.  It is
not used in the remaining steps below but must be created so it can be
loaded when a device and design are loaded in RapidSmith2.  <<The
creation of a cellLibrary.xml file is only done once for a given
family and already exists in the distribution for the Artix 7 family in
the devices/artix7 directory.>>

3. Create an XDLRC file.  For Series 7 and earlier devices, this can
be done using the following command in ISE: "xdl -report -pips
-all_conns <devname>".  For Ultrascale and later devices, the XDLRC
file will have to be created using Tincr.  

4. The Installer program within package edu.byu.ece.rapidSmith.util is
then run and it will generate the needed device files for RapidSmith2.
Running this program for the smallest Artix 7 part takes about a half
hour on a multi-core i7 machine.

Generating an XDLRC File
------------------------
As mentioned, this can be done from ISE using the command:

        xdl -report -pips -all_conns <devname> 

For Ultrascale and later devices you have to use the Tincr package to
generate an XDLRC file.  The Tincr project is a separate project at
Github (https://github.com/byuccl/tincr.git).  Once it is installed
and working, you generate an XDLRC file using the following command
inside the Vivado interactive Tcl shell:

tincr::write_xdlrc -part xc7a100tcsg324 -max_processes 1 -primitive_defs xc7a100tcsg324_full.xdlrc

The -max_processes tells the tool how many threads to use to generate
the file in parallel.  There have been issues with it hanging when
this is set to greater than 1.

The successful completion of this command relies on the existence of a
set of primitive definitions (primitive_defs) for a given family.
These must be manually created once per family and are stored in the
cache directory of Tincr.  Given that they exist, they are folded into
the XDLRC file when the above command is run.  They currently exist
for the Series 7 family (artix7, kintex7, virtex7).  If you desire to
generate device files for other families you must currently contact
BYU to see if primitive definition files have been created for that
family.

Running The Installer
---------------------
Once the XDLRC file has been created (and a familyInfo.xml file for
your technology is available), the Installer program within package
edu.byu.ece.rapidSmith.util can be run and it will generate the needed
device files for RapidSmith2.  Running this program for the smallest
Artix 7 part takes about a half hour on a multi-core i7 machine.

- The installer requires a parameter be passed which is the full path name
  to the xdlrc file (such as
  "/Users/smith/Documents/git/RapidSmith2/devices/artix7/xc7a100tcsg324_full.xdlrc").

- The installer will then deposit the resulting device files into the
  devices/familyName directory (devices/artix7 for the example
  above).  It determines the appropriate familyName to use from the
  contents of the XDLRC file.

- The VM also requires some arguments when running (such as
--XstartOnFirstThread Xmx14G) where 14G is the memory to give - set it
to most of the RAM on your machine,
  
The result of this process will be 2 files with .dat extensions.
The first is a *_db.dat file (which is the basic device file) and the
second is a *_info.dat file (which contains extended device
information such as reverse wire mappings).  Loading a device file in
RapidSmith2 will load only the first.  A separate call is required to
load the extended device info (see the API documentation for the
device package for details). 

 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
As a user desiring to generate new device files for an
already-supported family in RapidSmith2, you may quit reading here.
The following is information used to support new families of devices,
a task that is currently done by BYU.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

<< This is currently old information because RapidSmith2 is undergoing
changes in how the following two XML files are generated (it will
eventually be ~100% automated) .  The following text will be updated
when those changes are complete.>>

Generating A familyInfo.xml File >>

--------------------------------
As mentioned, the Virtex6 familyInfo_brent.xml family file
has been heavily commented and should be carefully looked at to
understand how to create such a file for another family.

For many (most?) site types, when going between Virtex6 and Virtex7,
if the name remains the same the structure remains the same between
the two technologies.  An example is BUFGCDTRL.  Thus, one strategy
for understanding the familyInfo.xml file is to find site types with
the same name between the two technologies and then look at the
Virtex7 site in the Vivado GUI while looking at the Virtex6
familyInfo.xml file.

Often, Virtex7 has a site type that is an augmented version of the
Virtex6 site and so comparing the Virtex6 XML file to the GUI can be
helpful. An example of this is IOB vs. IOB33.   Another example is
OLOGICE1 in Virtex6 and OLOGICE3 in Virtex7.

NOTE: much of the information in this guide duplicates what is in the
Virtex6 familyInfo.xml file.  However, there are differences so read
this and also that file.

GENERATE THE FRAMEWORK
----------------------

The Tcl program "sitesandbels.tcl" will generate the major portion of
the file.  It will do the following:

- For each primitive site, generate a primitive type record for its
  primary type and populate it with the list of BELS contained in that
  primitive type.  

- If the primitive type is of one of the special types (slices, dsps,
  iobs, etc) it will add a tag to mark this.  The determination of
  this is given by some simple rules based on the type name.  This may
  or may not be sufficient for new technologies (the script is easily
  modifiable).

- It also generates a corrections section based on whether it thinks
  the primary type might need them.

 - It then does the same thing but for alternative types for the
   primitive sites.  The main difference is it does not output
   possible alternatives of alternatives.

- Finally, if you read the code to sitesandbels.tcl you will find that
  it generates declarations for all the types Tcl can find for it, but
  that there are additional types that need to exist.  If not, an
  error will be thrown early in the Installer process.  The code
  actually has some hard-coded types that need to be included based on
  trial-and-error for Virtex7.  Other technologies may have their own
  lists.

MODIFYING THE GENERATED FILE
----------------------------

- Next, you must manually edit the generated file.  In the process you
  will: (a) remove alternate types that don't reallize exist and (b)
  edit the corrections.

- You need to understand alternate types to proceed.

- Each primitive site in the FPGA has at least one primitive type
  which can be place onto it.  This is called the "primary type" for the
  site.  However, some sites can be changed to one or more alternative
  types.  For example, the primary type for a BUFGCLK primitive site is
  the BUFGCLK type.  But, an alternative type for that site is a BUFG
  type (since a BUFGCLK can be used as a BUFG as well).

- A primitive site can have its type changed using the call:

      tincr::sites::set_type NEWTYPE

- However, when sites are configured to one of their alternate types, their
  BELs, site pins, etc. will change.

- The changes in BELs when this happens are easy to determine.  The
  sitesandbels.tcl script has code to print the BELs for both primary
  and alternate types.

- When doing the primary types for physical sites, the
  sitesandbels.tcl script looks to see if there are any alternative
  types for this physical site.  In some cases there are - IOB33S is
  an example. However, in some cases the query returns a list of
  alternative types which are wrong.  An example of this is IPAD. This
  is an alternative type for IOB33 but also is the primary type for
  some other physical sites such as IPAD_X1Y0 in part
  xc7a100t-csg324-1. When queried, this site returns a whole list of
  alternate types.  But, when you go into the GUI and look at it, this
  physical site has no alternative types.  Thus, one cannot tell from
  Tcl calls whether a physical site like this really has alternatives.

- The upshot is that for each site output that lists alternatives, one
  must go into the GUI and look at the actual site.  The way to do
  this would be to do this (this is not real Tcl code but some of this
  has to be done manually have to do manually, would love to automate
  this):

    foreach k in $keys where the familyInfo_new.xml file shows alternatives
      set s [dict get $dict $k]
      select_objects $s
      hit F9 to zoom to selected object
      hit CTRL-E to bring up object the Site Properties window
      look in the Site Properties windows to see if alternative types can be selected

- Based on this, you will remove some <alternative> records in the
  generated file (for ones that don't really exist).  An example is
  for IOB33.  It lists a bunch of alternatives but there really aren't
  any.

- For the alternative types that remain, when the site is changed to
  them, the site pins may also change.  

- For a site which has alternative types, the familyInfo.xml file
  will contain an <alternatives> section. For each alternative, the
  alternative type will be given followed by a pinmaps declaration.
  Often, this is empty, meaning that there is no change in site pins
  when the site is configured to the alternative type.  If there is a
  change in site pins, this will be included in the pinmaps section.

- An example of when there is a change of site pins is when an IOBS is
  configured to be of alternative type IPAD.  The IOBS has many pins,
  the IPAD has only one.  The mapping provided in the <pinmaps> list
  gives the name of a pin in the alternative type ("<name>O</name>" for
  example) and the pin in the original base type it is replacing
  ("<map>PADOUT</map>" for example).

- The above example may suggest that if a pinmaps section exists, it
  must contain all the pins in the new alternative type and all the
  old ones disappear.  This is not the case.  Rather, any pin that
  remaps a wire to a new pin name must be replaced.  In the Virtex6
  file, check out the primitive type ILOGICE1.  It has an alternative
  site type of ISERDESE1.  Note that a single pin (SR) from ILOGICE1
  has been remapped (to RST), even though many of the old pins remain
  used.  The single pin remapped is simply to show that the old SR pin
  is now known as RST.

- The changes in site pins for alternative types cannot currently be
  determined using Tcl (Brad White has posted to the Tcl user group to
  understand if this is a bug).  Thus, these remappings must be
  determined manually.  The simplest way to do this is using the
  Vivado GUI.

- Once you have the Site Properties window for a site up as described
  above, you can compare the pins between the primary type and the
  alternative thpe.

- This can be unwieldy.  My current approach is to do a screen capture
  or printout of the entire site so I can see all the pins.  I then
  change to one of the alternative types and do a screen capture of it
  or print it.  I then compare them side-by-side to see if any pins
  have been remapped.  Looking at IOBS (primary) and IPAD
  (alternative) in Virtex6 and then comparing to IOB33S (primary) and
  IPAD (alternative) in Virtex7 will help you understand what to look
  for.  If you see any that change, you need to add <pin> records to
  the <pinmaps> section.

- Fr example, find and look at an IOB33S.  Note the site pins.  Then,
  change the type to IPAD and look at the site pins.  You will see
  that pin PADOUT in the IOB33S and the O pin in the IPAD share the
  same node and that is what is put into the pinmaps section.

- Looking at the Virtex6 alternatives and pinmaps will provide
  guidance on how this is to be done in other families (there are lots
  of similarities between families).

- It is interesting that in previous families, a SLICEM could be
  configured as a SLICEL.  However, in Virtex7 in Vivado that does not
  seem to be the case.  That is, selecting a SLICEM does not show that
  it has any alternative types.  <<<?This seems odd?>>>

- A possible problem (talking with Travis) is what to do if an
  alternative type has new pins mapped to new wires that didn't exist
  for the primary type.  He says this shouldn't happen but I think I
  found it somewhere (forgot where).  If it does occur, need to decide
  what to do - Travis says RS2 won't work with this without some
  modifications.

COMPATIBLE SITE TYPES
---------------------

- There are compatible site types delarations which state that a site
  type can be placed onto a site of another type.  This seems to be
  the "opposite" of the alternative type relationship.  This could use
  some more clarification.  <<<?Ask Travis?>>>

CORRECTIONS
-----------

- It is possible that "corrections" may be needed to the XDLRC file's
  information to make it compatible with RapidSmith2.  There are a
  number of standard corrections that need to be done.

- The new_element tag is used to add CFG options to sites which are
  missing them.  This is needed when converting to/from XDL and ISE,
  but is not needed when going to/from EDIF and Vivado.  It is to
  provide configuration string mappings.  You should be able to ignore
  this. 

- The pin_direction tag is used to change the directions on pins.
  This is needed only for the pads and is used to change input pins to
  inout pins.  This can be created by looking through the pad cells in
  the Vivado GUI to obtain this information.  You need to change this
  for the pad cells.  Compare to V6 to understand.

- The modify_element tag is used to tag wiring MUXes that show up in
  the XDLRC as BELs.  That is, XDLRC declares some wiring MUXes as
  BELs when in reality they are not BELs but rather are wiring MUXes.
  Examining the Virtex6 instances of the modify_element will show
  that, with one exception, the structures tagged have the string
  "USED" at the end of the name.  The sitesandbels.tcl script outputs
  these based on what it can see but what it outputs needs editing.
  It generates these for any BEL which has routing PIPs in it.  That
  is, the tool reports lots of routing muxes as BELs which is
  incorrect.  So, what sitesandbels outputs is mostly correct.  The
  problem is that it tags the LUTs as routing muxes (because they have
  routing pips in them for when they are used as route-throughs).  You
  need to untag the LUTs by removing the modify_element tags for them.

- The polarity_selector tag is used to mark inverting MUXes in sites.
  For example, if you look in the Virtex-6 FPGA CLB User Guide from
  Xilinx and then look at the SLICEM and SLICEL diagrams, you will see
  a MUX on the CLK input wire.  It can be programmed to pass either
  CLK or the inverse of CLK into the SLICE.  Note that no inverter is
  actually drawn but rather just a bubble on the 2nd input to the MUX.
  These typically have INV on the end of the name.  The
  polarity_selector tag is used to mark these for the tools' benefit
  since no actual inverter shows up in the list of BELs.  The
  sitesandbels.tcl script outputs these as well and they seem to
  be correct.

- The sitesandbels.tcl script tries to populate the produced file by
  finding all structures inside the site that contain site pips.
  These are typically either polarity_selectors or muxes (but not
  always since LUTs and some other things show up as well).

- Thus, to handle the last 2 corrections (modify_element and
  polarity_selector), you just go through the generated file and find
  where sitesandbels.tcl has generated placeholder code.  Looking in
  the GUI will tell you which (one or both) of these generated
  placeholders you should delete.

- Then, find the INOUT pins in the PAD cells, add them, and you are
  done. 


========================================================================
Problems encountered:

- Sometimes what Tcl says  is different from what the GUI says.  Some
  alternatives are not correct.  They have been commented out as
  INVALID in the V7 familyInfo.xml file.

- The LUTs in the SLICEL and SLICEM primitives were all tagged as
  routing muxes in what sitesandbels outputs.  These tags need to be
  commented out.

========================================================================
Running FamilyBuilders

Once the above is complete, you must run
edu.byu.ece.rapidSmith.util.FamilyBuilders and supply any partname
from a family to it.  From this, the FamilyBuilders program will
generate a file in edu.byu.ece.rapidSmith.device.families for the
technology associated with that part.  For example for xc7a100tcsg324
it will generate Artix7.java.  This file contains a mapping from XXXXX
to YYYYYYY and must then be hand-edited to complete the task.  The
reason for this family is to avoid much of the family-specific code
that RapidSmith required and that was spread throughout the RapidSmith
code base.

The portion to edit is right at the bottom after the comment:

        /* ------ CLASSIFICATIONS GO HERE ------ */

Here is a sample from the Artix7.java file:

    /* ------ CLASSIFICATIONS GO HERE ------ */
        _CLB_TILES.add(TileTypes.CLBLL_L);
        _CLB_TILES.add(TileTypes.CLBLL_R);
        _CLB_TILES.add(TileTypes.CLBLM_L);
        _CLB_TILES.add(TileTypes.CLBLM_R);

        _SWITCHBOX_TILES.add(TileTypes.INT_L);
        _SWITCHBOX_TILES.add(TileTypes.INT_R);

        _BRAM_TILES.add(TileTypes.BRAM_L);
        _BRAM_TILES.add(TileTypes.BRAM_R);
	
        _DSP_TILES.add(TileTypes.DSP_L);
        _DSP_TILES.add(TileTypes.DSP_R);
	
        _IO_TILES.add(TileTypes.LIOI3_TBYTESRC);
        _IO_TILES.add(TileTypes.LIOB33_SING);
        _IO_TILES.add(TileTypes.LIOI3_SING);
        _IO_TILES.add(TileTypes.LIOI3_TBYTETERM);
        _IO_TILES.add(TileTypes.LIOI3);
        _IO_TILES.add(TileTypes.LIOB33);
        _IO_TILES.add(TileTypes.RIOI3);
        _IO_TILES.add(TileTypes.RIOB33);
        _IO_TILES.add(TileTypes.RIOI3_SING);
        _IO_TILES.add(TileTypes.RIOI3_TBYTETERM);

        _SLICE_SITES.add(SiteTypes.SLICEL);
        _SLICE_SITES.add(SiteTypes.SLICEM);
	
        _BRAM_SITES.add(SiteTypes.RAMB18E1);
        _BRAM_SITES.add(SiteTypes.RAMB36E1);
        _BRAM_SITES.add(SiteTypes.RAMBFIFO36E1);

        _DSP_SITES.add(SiteTypes.DSP48E1);

        _IO_SITES.add(SiteTypes.IOB33);
        _IO_SITES.add(SiteTypes.IOB33S);
        _IO_SITES.add(SiteTypes.IOB33M);
        _IO_SITES.add(SiteTypes.IPAD);
        _IO_SITES.add(SiteTypes.OPAD);

What this is doing is mapping tile types to tile categories and site
types to site categories.  In the example above, the tile and site
categories include:

        _CLB_TILES
        _SWITCHBOX_TILES
        _BRAM_TILES
        _DSP_TILES
        _IO_TILES

        _SLICE_SITES
        _BRAM_SITES
        _DSP_SITES
        _IO_SITES

The procedure to follow is to determine, from the list of TileTypes in
the auto-generated code section, which of those go into each of these
categories.  This should be fairly straightforward using the
Artix7.java file as a pattern.  ??? Can we provide a precise algorithm
for determining this ???
